# Cyber Crime Patterns in Indian Cities: A Data-Driven Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes cyber crime patterns across 190+ Indian cities using R and ggplot2. We investigate which crimes are most prevalent, where they occur, how motivations relate, and how fraud dominates India's cyber crime landscape.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: IndiaAPIs R package (`CyberCrime_India_tbl_df`)
- **Records**: 191 cities across India
- **Variables**: 15 different crime motivations + total incidents

## 🔍 Research Questions

1. Which cyber crime motivations are most prevalent across Indian cities?
2. How are cyber crimes geographically distributed and which cities have highest burden?
3. What is the relationship between different cyber crime motivations?
4. How does fraud compare to other motivations as a proportion of total cyber crime?

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Fraud dominance**: 59.6% of all cyber crimes are fraud-related
- **Urban concentration**: Major tech hubs (Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi) have highest incidents
- **Geographic inequality**: Crime burden distributed unevenly across cities
- **Diverse motivations**: Sexual exploitation, extortion, and personal revenge also significant

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: R
- **Libraries**: tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, scales
- **Output**: R Markdown → HTML
